Task Objectives

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the IMDb rating of a movie based on key features such as:

- Duration
- Number of Votes
- Genre(s)
- Director

We also engineer informative features like:
Director Success Rate** â€“ average rating of movies by the same director
Genre Average Rating** â€“ average rating of movies in the same genre(s)


 How to Run This Project


1. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the Code

```bash
python movie.py
```

The script will:
- Train a predictive model (if not already saved)
- Prompt the user to input details of a new movie
- Output the predicted IMDb rating
